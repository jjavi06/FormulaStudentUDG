        "title2": "What is formula student?",
        "p6": "Formula Student is an international engineering competition that challenges university students to design, build, and race single-seater cars. The competition not only tests technical skills but also promotes innovative thinking and pragmatic problem-solving, as teams must tackle challenges ranging from design and manufacturing to economic and commercial management. In doing so, participants develop a comprehensive set of skills that combine theoretical knowledge with practical experience in a demanding and competitive environment — preparing them for future challenges."
